Blinker is a low contrast sans serif typeface with a <em>squircle</em> as its basic shape, think squarish curves. Think Eurostyle before the Brexit. Itâ€™s best used for medium to large text, rather than a long copy. To do its claim justice Blinker also comes with a headline weight with an extra large x-height, tight spacing, and glyphs drawn more narrowly. Blink!

The original 9 weights with a latin extended glyph set were designed by Juergen Huber in 2019.<br>
